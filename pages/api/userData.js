  aboutMe: `Hi, my name is Alexandru, but you can call me Alex. I'm a 25-year-old web developer from Romania. It all started as a hobby; all I wanted was to create a website for myself where I could list all the movies I've watched. Starting with HTML and CSS to build the website and struggling to make a button work, I have now advanced to working with JavaScript and frameworks to develop incredible websites. Google has been my best teacher throughout this journey of learning web development.`,
